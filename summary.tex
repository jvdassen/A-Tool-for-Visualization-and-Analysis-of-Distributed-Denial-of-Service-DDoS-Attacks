\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\section{Future Work}
As future work of this solution we see the improvements and extensions outlined in section \ref{limitations}. The main areas of future work are thus the integration of new data sources and data processing. Next the extension using new protocol parsers and feature extractors would conclude the future work of the backend modules. For the frontend the future work consists of improvements such as user management, display and capture filtering as well as additional visualizations.

The prototypical implementation described in this paper resembles a general purpose analysis and visualization system. An interesting work would be to use this platform as a basis to investigate a specific attack or technology and determine its fit for the application in such a context.
